# Step 2: Duplicate Analysis and Comparison

**Purpose:** Compare the 3 pending duplicate files side-by-side and make final decisions on which versions to keep. This ensures we move the correct versions in Step 3 instead of moving duplicates then deleting.

**Prerequisites:**

- [x] Step 1 completed (inventory identified 6 duplicates)
- [x] 3 duplicates already decided (Modal, FadeTransition, LoadingDisplay - keep core/ui versions)
- [ ] 3 duplicates need comparison (FormField, NumberedInstructions, StatusCard)

**Tests to Write First:**

- [ ] Test: Verify duplicate files exist before comparison
  - **Given:** Step 1 inventory complete
  - **When:** Check both locations for FormField, NumberedInstructions, StatusCard
  - **Then:** Both versions of each file exist
  - **File:** Manual test

- [ ] Test: Verify comparison results documented
  - **Given:** All 3 duplicates compared
  - **When:** Read duplicate-analysis.md
  - **Then:** Clear decision documented for each duplicate with rationale
  - **File:** Manual test

- [ ] Test: Verify import usage analysis for duplicates
  - **Given:** Import analysis from Step 1
  - **When:** Check which duplicate version is imported
  - **Then:** Confirm active version matches or document migration needed
  - **File:** Grep analysis

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- [ ] `.rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/duplicate-analysis.md` - Update with comparison results
- [ ] `.rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/formfield-comparison.txt` - Side-by-side diff
- [ ] `.rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/numberedinstructions-comparison.txt` - Side-by-side diff
- [ ] `.rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/statuscard-comparison.txt` - Side-by-side diff

**Implementation Details:**

**RED Phase** (Compare duplicate files)

Compare each of the 3 pending duplicates side-by-side:

```bash
# 1. Compare FormField.tsx

**Report RED State:**
```text

```

**GREEN Phase** (Document comparison results and decisions)

Analyze each comparison and update duplicate-analysis.md:

# Update it with detailed comparison results

cat >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/duplicate-analysis.md << 'EOF'

**Comparison Summary:**
[Review statuscard-comparison.txt and document key differences]

**Import Usage:**

- [ ] Keep `src/webviews/components/molecules/StatusCard.tsx` (rationale: [explain])
- [ ] Merge both (rationale: [explain])

## Final Merge Strategy (All 6 Duplicates)

### Confirmed to Keep from src/core/ui/ (3 duplicates)
1. âœ… Modal.tsx â†’ DELETE src/webviews/components/shared/Modal.tsx
2. âœ… FadeTransition.tsx â†’ DELETE src/webviews/components/shared/FadeTransition.tsx
3. âœ… LoadingDisplay.tsx â†’ DELETE src/webviews/components/shared/LoadingDisplay.tsx

### Pending Decision (3 duplicates - to be determined in GREEN phase)
4. [ ] FormField.tsx â†’ Decision: [TBD]
5. [ ] NumberedInstructions.tsx â†’ Decision: [TBD]
6. [ ] StatusCard.tsx â†’ Decision: [TBD]

### Import Migration Required
If any @/webviews versions are chosen, need to update imports from @/core/ui â†’ @/webview-ui/shared

EOF
```

**Report GREEN State:**
```text
ðŸŸ¢ GREEN Phase Complete - Step 2

âœ… All 3 duplicates compared side-by-side
âœ… Import usage analyzed
âœ… Decisions documented in duplicate-analysis.md
âœ… Final merge strategy updated

Decisions made:
- FormField.tsx: [DECISION]
- NumberedInstructions.tsx: [DECISION]
- StatusCard.tsx: [DECISION]
```

**REFACTOR Phase** (Validate decisions)

Validate that decisions are sound:

```bash
# 1. Cross-check import counts with decisions
echo "=== Decision Validation ===" > .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt
echo "" >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt
echo "Validating that chosen versions are actively imported..." >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt
echo "" >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt

# For each duplicate, verify the chosen version matches import usage
# If not, document migration plan

# 2. Verify no circular dependencies
echo "Checking for circular dependencies in duplicate components..." >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt

# 3. Check if any deleted versions have unique features
echo "" >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt
echo "Checking if discarded versions have unique features..." >> .rptc/plans/webview-architecture-restructure/decision-validation.txt

# Compare props, methods, hooks usage
# Document if any features need to be merged before deletion
```

**Report REFACTOR Complete:**
```text
ðŸ”§ REFACTOR Phase Complete - Step 2

âœ… Decisions validated against import usage
âœ… No circular dependencies detected
âœ… No unique features lost in discarded versions

All 6 duplicates resolved:
- 3 core/ui versions confirmed (Modal, FadeTransition, LoadingDisplay)
- 3 comparison decisions finalized (FormField, NumberedInstructions, StatusCard)

Ready for Step 3: Directory creation with correct versions.
```

**Expected Outcome:**

- All 6 duplicates have final decisions documented
- Comparison diffs saved for reference
- Import usage analyzed to validate decisions
- Decision rationale documented for each duplicate
- No code changes yet (analysis only)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] FormField.tsx comparison completed with decision documented
- [ ] NumberedInstructions.tsx comparison completed with decision documented
- [ ] StatusCard.tsx comparison completed with decision documented
- [ ] All 6 duplicates have final merge decisions in duplicate-analysis.md
- [ ] Import usage validates decisions (active versions are chosen)
- [ ] Decision validation report created
- [ ] No unique features lost from discarded versions
- [ ] No code changes made (analysis only)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

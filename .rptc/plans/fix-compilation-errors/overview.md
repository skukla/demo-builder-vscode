## Executive Summary

### Feature
Resolve 644 TypeScript compilation errors caused by incomplete @/core/* refactoring where imports were changed to @/core/* paths but files were never moved to those locations.

### Purpose
Restore project compilation by systematically fixing import paths to reference actual file locations (@/shared/*, @/types/*, existing structure) while preserving intentionally correct @/core/* imports (config, ui, commands, validation).

### Approach
7-step systematic refactoring: analyze errors → map correct paths → add missing exports → batch fix imports → verify compilation → comprehensive testing. Manual file-by-file verification with test checkpoints after each major batch.

### Complexity
Medium-High - Straightforward path corrections but requires careful analysis of 644 errors across 100+ files, distinguishing correct vs incorrect @/core/* imports, and ensuring no runtime regressions.

### Timeline
3-4 hours estimated (1h analysis/mapping, 2h systematic fixes, 1h verification/testing)

### Key Risks
1. Breaking dynamic imports (75 import() statements)
2. Incorrect path mappings causing cascading failures
3. Missing exports not discovered until compilation

---

## Test Strategy

### Framework
- TypeScript compiler (tsc --noEmit)
- Jest unit test suite
- Manual verification per file

### Coverage Goals
- **Compilation:** 0 TypeScript errors (down from 644)
- **Unit Tests:** Maintain 85%+ coverage, all existing tests passing
- **Integration Tests:** No new failures introduced
- **Runtime:** No new runtime errors

### Test Scenarios Summary

**Compilation Testing:**
- Verify 0 TypeScript errors after each step
- Confirm path aliases resolve correctly
- Check no new errors introduced

**Unit Testing:**
- All existing unit tests pass unchanged
- Feature-specific test suites (authentication, prerequisites, mesh, etc.)
- Shared infrastructure tests (logging, communication, state)

**Integration Testing:**
- Dynamic import() statements work correctly
- Feature modules load without errors
- Extension activation succeeds

**Manual Verification:**
- Inspect each changed import for correctness
- Verify barrel exports include all needed functions
- Test key workflows (authentication, project creation, mesh deployment)

**Note:** Detailed test scenarios with Given-When-Then format are in each step file (step-01.md through step-07.md)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|----------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Breaking dynamic imports | Technical | Medium | High | Document all 75 import() locations before changes; verify each after fix | Revert affected files using git; re-analyze imports |
| Incorrect path mapping | Technical | Medium | High | Create comprehensive mapping document in Step 2; peer review mappings | Revert to mapping document; re-verify each path |
| Missing exports discovered late | Technical | Medium | Medium | Add all missing exports in Step 3 before path fixes | Add exports incrementally as discovered; recompile frequently |
| Cascading type errors | Technical | Low | High | Fix imports in dependency order (types → shared → features → commands) | Isolate error chains; fix root cause types first |
| Runtime errors not caught by compiler | Technical | Low | Medium | Manual testing of key workflows after each step | Comprehensive integration testing before final commit |

## Coordination Notes

### Step Dependencies
- **Step 2 depends on Step 1:** Mapping document requires categorized error analysis
- **Step 3 blocks Steps 4-5:** Missing exports must exist before fixing imports
- **Steps 4-5 sequential:** Batch 1 (high-impact) before Batch 2 (lower-impact)
- **Step 7 depends on Steps 4-6:** Final verification after all fixes complete

### Integration Points
- **All features affected:** Cross-cutting import path changes
- **Shared infrastructure:** Logging, communication, state management imports
- **Type system:** Core type definitions used everywhere
- **Test suite:** Must pass after each step

### Batch Strategy
- **Step 4 Batch 1:** Authentication, prerequisites (high-test-coverage features)
- **Step 5 Batch 2:** Mesh, dashboard, lifecycle, updates
- **Step 6 Batch 3:** Components, commands (complex type issues + signature mismatches)
- **Rationale:** Fix well-tested code first to catch issues early, then tackle complex type/structural issues

---

## Implementation Constraints

### File Size
- No constraints (refactoring existing code only)

### Complexity
- Maintain current complexity (no logic changes)
- Preserve existing patterns and conventions

### Dependencies
- **PROHIBITED:** Adding new npm packages
- **REQUIRED:** Use existing @/shared/*, @/types/*, @/core/* structure
- **PATTERN:** Follow established import conventions per `architecture-patterns.md`

### Platforms
- TypeScript strict mode
- Node.js 18+
- VS Code Extension API compatibility

### Performance
- No performance impact expected (compile-time changes only)

---

## Assumptions

**IMPORTANT:** Verify these assumptions before implementation:

- [ ] **Assumption 1:** TypeScript path aliases in tsconfig.json are correct
  - **Source:** VERIFIED - tsconfig.json inspected, paths configured correctly
  - **Impact if Wrong:** All imports would fail; would need tsconfig fixes first

- [ ] **Assumption 2:** @/core/* legitimately contains: config, ui, commands, validation, constants
  - **Source:** VERIFIED - src/core/ directory listing confirms these directories exist
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Would need to relocate core modules; major refactor

- [ ] **Assumption 3:** @/shared/* contains: base, command-execution, communication, logging, state, utils, validation
  - **Source:** VERIFIED - src/shared/ directory listing confirms structure
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Import paths would be incorrect; need structural analysis

- [ ] **Assumption 4:** Validation functions exist in @/shared/validation/securityValidation.ts
  - **Source:** VERIFIED - Grep search confirmed exports exist
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Would need to implement validation functions from scratch

- [ ] **Assumption 5:** Dynamic import() statements mostly use @/features/* (unaffected by refactor)
  - **Source:** ASSUMED based on standard practice - needs verification in Step 1
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Would need to fix dynamic imports too; expand scope

- [ ] **Assumption 6:** No DI framework is actually used (di.ts doesn't exist)
  - **Source:** VERIFIED - find command returned no di.ts files
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Would need to implement DI module or find actual location

- [ ] **Assumption 7:** Error types are defined inline or in @/shared/base/ (not @/core/errors)
  - **Source:** ASSUMED - no errors.ts file found
  - **Impact if Wrong:** Would need to create or locate error types module

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Begin Step 1: Run `npx tsc --noEmit > errors.txt` to capture all errors
2. Categorize errors by type (module not found, missing export, type errors)
3. Create systematic error pattern analysis
4. Proceed to Step 2: Create comprehensive import mapping document

### For Developers
- **Start Command:** `/rptc:tdd "@fix-compilation-errors/"`
- **Review Mapping:** Carefully review Step 2 mapping document before bulk fixes
- **Test Frequently:** Run `npx tsc --noEmit` after each file batch
- **Git Commits:** Commit after each completed step for easy rollback

### Quality Gates
1. After Step 3: Verify exports resolve correctly
2. After Step 4: Run full test suite (authentication, prerequisites)
3. After Step 5: Run full test suite (all features)
4. After Step 7: Manual workflow testing

## Implementation Notes (Updated During TDD Phase)

**This section filled during implementation by TDD phase.**

### Completed Steps

**Step 1: Analyze and Categorize Errors** (2025-10-28)
- ✅ Captured raw compiler output (91 errors, revised from 644 estimate)
- ✅ Categorized all errors by type
- ✅ Analyzed @/core/* import patterns
- ✅ Identified correct vs incorrect imports
- ✅ Created comprehensive error-analysis.md document
- **Key Finding**: Actual error count is 91 (not 644), significantly reducing scope and timeline

**Step 2: Create Import Mapping Document** (2025-10-28)
- ✅ Mapped all 7 incorrect @/core/* imports to correct locations
- ✅ Verified file existence for all replacement paths
- ✅ Identified missing exports needed (DataResult, validation index.ts)
- ✅ Documented manual refactoring needs (@/core/di removal)
- ✅ Created comprehensive import-mapping.md with risk assessment
- **Key Finding**: 14 files ready for automated fixes, 8 need Step 3 actions, 3 need manual refactoring

**Step 3: Add Missing Exports and Index Files** (2025-10-28)
- ✅ Created `src/core/validation/index.ts` barrel export (re-exports from @/shared/validation)
- ✅ Added `DataResult<T>` type alias to `src/types/results.ts`
- ✅ Verified both files compile without errors
- ✅ Fixed 6 compilation errors (4 validation module errors + 2 DataResult export errors)
- **Key Finding**: Export fixes successful, ready for Step 4 import path corrections

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Branch:** refactor/eliminate-frontend-duplicates
**Commit:** e29dc67d5f0e1ff14d295f19665f10f3333b4115

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive final verification of frontend architecture cleanup. All automated verification criteria met with significant improvements over baseline. TypeScript errors reduced by 35.7%, Webpack build succeeds with 4 bundles, and all code duplication eliminated.

---

## Tests Written

**Verification Tests (3 automated):**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation test (expect ≤14 errors) - PASSED (9 errors, IMPROVED)
- ✅ Webpack build test (expect 4 bundles) - PASSED (SUCCESS)
- ✅ No @/core/ui imports test (expect 0) - PASSED (0 imports)

**Manual Tests (4 webviews):**
- [ ] Wizard webview - RECOMMENDED for PM (not blocking)
- [ ] Dashboard webview - RECOMMENDED for PM (not blocking)
- [ ] Configure webview - RECOMMENDED for PM (not blocking)
- [ ] Welcome webview - RECOMMENDED for PM (not blocking)

**Tests Passing:** 3/3 automated (100%), manual testing optional

## Verification Results

### 1. TypeScript Compilation

**Baseline (Step 1):** 14 errors
**Final (Step 6):** 9 errors
**Improvement:** -5 errors (35.7% reduction)

**Error Breakdown (9 errors):**
- 4 errors: `adobeEntityService.ts` (pre-existing type mismatches, unrelated to refactor)
- 5 errors: `WebviewCommunicationManager` (pre-existing missing methods, unrelated to refactor)

**Status:** ✅ IMPROVED

**Note:** All remaining errors existed BEFORE refactoring and are unrelated to frontend architecture cleanup.

---

### 2. Webpack Build

**Baseline (Step 1):** FAILED (TypeScript errors blocked build)
**Final (Step 6):** SUCCESS (4 bundles generated)

**Bundle Details:**
- `wizard-bundle.js`: 2.1M (production, minified)
- `welcome-bundle.js`: 610K (production, minified)
- `dashboard-bundle.js`: 1.1M (production, minified)
- `configure-bundle.js`: 1.5M (production, minified)

**Total Bundle Size:** ~5.3M
**Compilation Time:** 4568ms
**Webpack Version:** 5.101.3

**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

---

### 3. Import Path Verification

**Test:** `grep -r "from ['\"]@/core/ui" src/ tests/ webview-ui/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`
**Result:** 0 imports found

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - No @/core/ui imports remain

---

### 4. Test File Migration

**Test Files Moved:** 10 files
- 9 hook tests: `tests/core/ui/hooks/` → `tests/webview-ui/shared/hooks/`
- 1 component test: `tests/core/ui/components/` → `tests/webview-ui/shared/components/feedback/`

**Git History:** Preserved with `git mv` command
**Verification:** `git log --follow` shows full history

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

---

### 5. Directory Cleanup

**Verified Deleted:**
- `src/core/ui/` - DELETED ✅
- `webview-ui/src/shared/components/atoms/` - DELETED ✅
- `webview-ui/src/shared/components/molecules/` - DELETED ✅
- `webview-ui/src/shared/components/organisms/` - DELETED ✅
- `webview-ui/src/shared/components/templates/` - DELETED ✅
- `tests/core/ui/` - DELETED ✅

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Before Refactoring
- `src/core/ui/`: 2,285 lines (duplicates)
- Atomic design: atoms/, molecules/, organisms/, templates/
- Import pattern: `@/core/ui/*`
- File count: 35 files in src/core/ui/
- Test structure: `tests/core/ui/`

### After Refactoring
- `src/core/ui/`: DELETED
- Function-based: ui/, forms/, feedback/, navigation/, layout/
- Import pattern: `@/webview-ui/shared/*` (function-based)
- File count: 0 (all migrated to webview-ui/src/shared/)
- Test structure: `tests/webview-ui/shared/`

### Benefits Achieved
- Code duplication: ELIMINATED (2,285 lines)
- Architecture clarity: IMPROVED (clear extension host vs webview boundary)
- Component organization: IMPROVED (function-based vs size-based)
- Import paths: SIMPLIFIED (single source of truth)
- Maintainability: IMPROVED (no duplicate updates needed)
- TypeScript errors: REDUCED by 5 (35.7% improvement)

---

## Files Changed Summary

**Deleted:**
- 35 files (src/core/ui/)
- 11 files (dead code - ui/main/ entry points)
- Total: 46 files deleted

**Migrated:**
- 32 components (to webview-ui/src/shared/)

**Updated:**
- 40 files (import path updates)

**Moved:**
- 10 test files (with git history preserved)

**Created:**
- 8 verification documents

**Net Line Change:**
- Removed: ~4,640 lines (duplicates + dead code)

---

## Coverage for This Step

**Not applicable** - Verification step doesn't add new functionality, only validates existing work.

**Test Preservation:** All 10 test files migrated successfully with full git history.

---

## Refactorings Applied

**N/A** - Verification step, no refactoring performed.

---

## Implementation Constraints Respected

**From overview.md:**
- ✅ Test preservation: All test files migrated with history
- ✅ Zero new errors: TypeScript errors IMPROVED (14 → 9)
- ✅ Build success: Webpack generates 4 bundles
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met

---

## Blockers or Notes

**None** - All verification criteria exceeded.

**Notes:**
1. TypeScript errors IMPROVED by 35.7% (from 14 to 9)
2. Remaining 9 errors are pre-existing and unrelated to refactoring
3. Webpack build now succeeds independently (baseline failed)
4. Manual testing guide provided for optional PM review
5. All documentation comprehensive and ready for review

---

## Ready for Next Step

✅ **YES** - All automated verification complete.

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Verification documents committed
2. [ ] OPTIONAL: PM manual testing of 4 webviews
3. [ ] Request Efficiency Agent review (if enabled)
4. [ ] Mark plan as COMPLETE
5. [ ] Consider PR creation with `/rptc:commit pr`

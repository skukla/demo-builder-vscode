Dead Code Summary
=================

Generated: Wed Oct 29, 2025

Components Analysis:
  Total Components: 30
  Unused Components (DELETE): 2
  Flagged for Review (REVIEW): 7
  To Migrate (MIGRATE): 21

Hooks Analysis:
  Total Hooks: 21
  Unused Hooks (DELETE): 9 (all .d.ts TypeScript declaration files)
  To Migrate (MIGRATE): 12

Tests Analysis:
  Total Tests: Many analyzed
  Orphaned Tests: Many (detailed in usage-report-tests.txt)
  Note: Test deletion deferred to Step 3 (after source migration)

Total Dead Code (Immediate Deletion):
  Components: 2 files (TerminalOutput, WidthDebugger)
  Hooks: 9 files (all .d.ts declaration files)
  Tests: Deferred to Step 3
  TOTAL FILES TO DELETE: 11 files

Conservative Decisions:
  Components flagged REVIEW (1-2 usages): 7 files
  Decision: MIGRATE all (conservative approach - script may undercount)
  Rationale: Better to migrate and discover unused later than delete and break something

Recommended Action:
  1. DELETE 2 unused components before migration
  2. DELETE 9 unused .d.ts hook files before migration
  3. MIGRATE 7 flagged components (conservative - likely undercount)
  4. MIGRATE 21 confirmed-used components
  5. MIGRATE 12 confirmed-used hooks
  6. DEFER test deletion to Step 3 (after source migration complete)

Confidence Level: HIGH
  - DELETE decisions verified with manual spot-checks
  - Script is conservative (undercounts usage, biased toward MIGRATE)
  - No dynamic imports or template literals hiding usage
  - TypeScript .d.ts files safe to delete (auto-generated)

Next Steps:
  1. Proceed to Step 2: Create Function-Based Directory Structure
  2. In Step 3: Integrate conditional git rm vs git mv based on reports
  3. Delete components marked DELETE
  4. Migrate components marked MIGRATE or REVIEW
  5. Clean up orphaned tests after source migration

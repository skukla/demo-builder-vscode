# Build roadmap — Commerce-connect for federated AEM Sites demos

**Filed:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Roadmap (build sequence). Detailed TDD plans are produced **just-in-time** per slice.
**Design:** [commerce-connection-kit](./commerce-connection-kit.md) (mechanism) · [federated-two-instance-demos](./federated-two-instance-demos.md) (operator model) · [aem-sc-first-run](./aem-sc-first-run.md) (front door / first-run).

## The model in one line

The AEM SC's *own* extension instance: enter the Commerce demo's **published storefront URL** → **discover** the commerce connection (it's public) → **scaffold `xcom`** in their org → **apply** → **guide** the no-API AEM wiring → author in their AEM Sites. **v1 = 2 repos sharing data;** the later higher-cohesion layer = 3 repos (shared upstream + synced forks) for shared custom code.

## Slices

### Slice 1 — Discover the commerce connection from a published storefront URL ← **first**
- **Goal:** a pure service — URL in → typed `CommerceConnection` out.
- **Scope:** fetch `{url}/config.json`, parse, extract the commerce subset (endpoints + headers).
- **Reuse:** native `fetch()` + `AbortSignal.timeout()` (from `commerceStoreDiscovery.ts`); field names from `configGenerator.ts` / `config-template.json`.
- **Unknowns:** config-service `public.json` vs root `config.json` precedence.
- **Effort:** S. **Plan:** [Slice 1 — discovery](./slice1-discovery.md) (ready for TDD).

### Slice 2 — Apply a discovered connection to a target storefront's config
- **Goal:** write a `CommerceConnection` into a storefront's config (`config.json` / Configuration Service).
- **Reuse:** `configGenerator` (produces this exact shape) + `configurationService` (the PUT).
- **Milestone:** after 1–2 you have a *demonstrable* result — URL in → working config out.
- **Effort:** S–M. Plannable in detail now (do after Slice 1 lands).

### Slice 3 — Scaffold `xcom` into the AEM SC's org
- **Goal:** template-copy `adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom` into the AEM SC's GitHub org.
- **Reuse:** the repo-from-template machinery (project creation).
- **Unknowns:** auth to the AEM SC's GitHub org; `xcom` template stability/version pinning.
- **Prereq created here:** when this writes the AEM project record, set the manifest **`kind: aem-storefront`** (additive; existing projects default to `commerce-demo`). This is what the front door + dashboard (Slice 4) branch on — see [aem-sc-first-run](./aem-sc-first-run.md).
- **Effort:** M. Plan JIT.

### Slice 4 — AEM-SC front door + connect-flow UI + shared-surface adaptation
- **Goal:** the coherent **AEM-SC first-run** (full design: [aem-sc-first-run](./aem-sc-first-run.md)): a top-level **router** ("Commerce demo" | "AEM Sites storefront"), the **AEM-framed connect flow** (paste URL → discover → confirm → scaffold → guided AEM wiring → author in UE), and **shared-surface adaptation** — the dashboard/sidebar branch on the project `kind`, so an AEM project shows **Author in AEM** + a **commerce-connection** status and *hides* DA.live authoring / Sync Storefront / Deploy Mesh (the AEM SC owns none of those).
- **Guided part:** the no-API AEM steps (Code Sync, Cloud Manager site, IMS roles, UE enablement) as a checklist with verify affordances.
- **Why bigger than "a surface":** this is where commerce-centricity stops being additive — the router *is* minimal product-selection, and the dashboard/manifest need `kind`-branching. (The deep solution-family refactor is still NOT required — the AEM flow is its own path, not the commerce wizard.)
- **Unknowns:** router placement (empty state vs "+ New" vs first-run welcome); adapt-dashboard vs AEM variant; wizard vs single-screen; UI vs agent.
- **Effort:** M–L. Plan JIT — and likely split into "front door + manifest `kind`" and "AEM connect-flow UI + dashboard adaptation" sub-slices.

### Slice 5 (deferred) — Higher cohesion: shared upstream + synced forks + custom-code contribution
- **Goal:** the 3-repo model — a shared **upstream** both SCs' repos sync from, so both SCs' custom **blocks** (block library) + **drop-ins** (feature pack) land in one storefront. *(NB: "upstream" ≠ ADR-003 "canonical repo" — see federated doc terminology note.)*
- **Reuse:** `templateSyncService`/`componentUpdater` (sync), block-libraries, `featurePackInstaller`.
- **Unknowns:** the two-way contribution flow; multi-fork sync coordination.
- **Effort:** L. Deferred — v1 doesn't need it. Plan JIT when reached.

## Optional parallel track (not in the main sequence)

- **Harden the shared canvas** (UE-on-DA): promote the existing `demoBuilder.daLive.aemAuthorUrl`/`IMSOrgId` settings (`applyDaLiveOrgConfigSettings`) into a first-class surface. Separate and smaller; delivers the *shared canvas*, **not** the AEM SC's own instance. See the connection-kit doc's "two meanings of connect."

## Future (out of scope here)

- **Product selection** (AEM as a *standalone* product) — the solution-family refactor; a deliberate later bet (connection-kit "Product-flow context").

## Sequencing principle

Detailed TDD plans are written **just-in-time**. Slices 1–2 are concrete now; **3–5 carry real unknowns** (cross-org behavior, the no-API AEM steps, the sync model) and depend on learnings from 1–2 — so they stay roadmap-level until reached, to avoid plan rot.

# Files over the god-file threshold

**Filed:** 2026-08-15, from the `fix/field-128-bugs` release prep.
**Severity:** low — a project guideline, not a gate. `eslint` does not flag these
and CI does not fail on them.

## The two files

Project CLAUDE.md sets the services threshold at **400 lines**. Both of these
were already over it before the branch that filed this item:

| File | at `develop` | after the branch | net |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/features/eds/services/configurationService.ts` | 444 | 532 | +88 |
| `src/features/eds/services/edsResetService.ts` | 430 | 463 | +33 |

The branch's own additions were extracted back out before shipping, and the
extractions are the model for the rest:

- `siteGrantPreservation.ts` (109) — capture/restore of admin grants across the
  delete-and-re-register cycle, out of `configurationService`.
- `edsResetConfigStep.ts` (165) — reset steps 6-7, out of `edsResetService`.
- `siteConfigRegistrar.ts` (238) — the 409/401/403 registration protocol, out of
  `configServiceRegistration`.

Each was behaviour-preserving and proved it the same way: the existing suites
passed **untouched** (238 and 195 tests respectively). Any further split should
clear the same bar — if a test has to change, the extraction changed behaviour.

## Explicitly NOT in scope: `configServiceAccess.ts`

493 lines, and new on that branch, so it looks like the obvious third candidate.
It is not. Measured 2026-08-15: **207 of those lines are comments**, leaving ~286
of code, and its exports are one coherent contract — read the org roster, read
site access, probe, grant, revoke, restore, build the Code Sync setup link. The
`decompose-god-file` skill is for MULTI-RESPONSIBILITY files; this one fails that
test, and splitting it would scatter a single API across modules to satisfy a
line count that is mostly the documentation worth keeping.

Do not "fix" it without first re-checking the comment ratio and the export list.

## Why it was deferred rather than done

The branch that filed this ran a five-iteration verify loop, and three of those
iterations found regressions introduced by the previous iteration's fixes —
including one that aborted a half-completed reset after the repo had already been
wiped, and one that silently switched off three recovery paths. A structural
refactor with no user-visible benefit, at the end of that, on code that had just
been verified live, was the wrong bet.

## When to pick it up

At a release cut, via `codebase-sweep` — which is when that skill is designed to
run, and which will re-measure rather than trusting the numbers above.

## Kickoff prompt

> Read `.rptc/backlog/eds-services-over-size-threshold.md`. Re-measure both files
> first (they may have moved). Split `configurationService.ts` and
> `edsResetService.ts` along responsibility lines using `decompose-god-file`,
> following `siteGrantPreservation.ts` and `edsResetConfigStep.ts` as the model.
> The bar is that the existing suites pass UNTOUCHED — a test that has to change
> means the extraction changed behaviour. Leave `configServiceAccess.ts` alone
> unless its comment ratio and export list say otherwise; the item explains why.

## `edsPipeline.ts` was added here and then REMOVED — 2026-08-19

It was filed here on size alone (839 lines). Running `decompose-god-file`'s own
test rejected it, and the correction is worth keeping because size was the wrong
reason both times:

| Coupling signal | Threshold | `edsPipeline.ts` |
|---|---|---|
| non-type imports | >15 | **5** |
| public methods | >10 | **1** (`executeEdsPipeline`) |
| entity domains | multiple | one — the pipeline |

The skill's rule is "threshold WITHOUT coupling → leave it". The file is one
orchestrator plus eight private step helpers: cohesive, one public entry point,
one reason to change per step but all serving the same pipeline.

**And decomposing would not have fixed the thing that prompted it.** The eslint
warning is `executeEdsPipeline` at cyclomatic complexity 27 (limit 25), and every
one of those branches is step-gating INSIDE that function — `clearExistingContent`,
`skipContent`, `contentSource`, `includeBlockLibrary`, `purgeCache`, `skipPublish`,
`libraryPaths.length`, `byomOverlayUrl && project`, plus nested try/catch. Moving
the helpers to another file leaves all of them. The file shrinks; the warning stays.

Refiled as `2026-08-19-eds-pipeline-orchestrator-complexity.md`, which is a
complexity-reduction item, not a decomposition one.

## Measured 2026-08-19 — `edsResetService.ts` is the genuine candidate here

Of the three files, only this one shows the coupling the skill looks for: **440
lines with 16 non-type imports**, over the >15 signal. `configurationService.ts` is
532 lines with **2** non-type imports and 7 public methods — over on size, under on
every coupling signal, so the same "leave it" verdict applies until something else
argues otherwise.

## Re-measured 2026-08-19 (second pass) — this item was pointed at the wrong files

The two files in the title are the two SMALLEST candidates in the repo. Measured
across `src/` with the coupling signals the `decompose-god-file` skill actually
uses, not line count:

| File | code lines | non-type imports | public methods | filed here before? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `project-creation/handlers/executor.ts` | 1403 | **23** | **33** | no |
| `eds/services/helixService.ts` | 1313 | 8 | **16** | no |
| `authentication/services/adobeEntityFetcher.ts` | 1232 | 9 | **21** | no |
| `mcp-server.ts` | 1291 | 11 | — | no |
| `eds/services/daLiveContentCopy.ts` | 811 | 13 | — | no |
| `eds/services/configurationService.ts` | 532 | 2 | 7 | yes |
| `eds/services/edsResetService.ts` | 343 | **16** | 2 | yes |

Signals over threshold in **bold** (>15 non-type imports, >10 public methods).

`configurationService.ts` is filed here and fails the coupling test — this item's
own later section already reaches that verdict. `helixService.ts` was never
filed and is an EDS service at nearly four times its size.

The pattern is that this item tracks files somebody happened to touch, not files
measurement condemns. Anyone picking work off it should re-measure first; the
table above is the current answer.

## `helixService.ts` — one cut taken, the rest is not free

**Done:** `helixKeyStore.ts` (168 lines) now owns Admin API key persistence —
the keychain, the one-time migration off plaintext globalState, the in-memory
cache and the two expiries. That is a credential store; it knows nothing about
`admin.hlx.page`, and the class knew nothing about keychains, so they were two
responsibilities sharing a file. `HelixService`'s four public statics
(`initKeyStore`, `clearKeyStore`, `clearApiKeyCache`, `forgetApiKey`) delegate
and keep their signatures, so the three external callers did not change.

Cleared the bar this item sets: **88 tests across 7 suites passed untouched.**

**Not done, and not cheap.** The next clusters are entangled with instance
state in a way the key store was not:

- **Bulk-job protocol** (`parseBulkJobResponse`, `pollJobCompletion`,
  `assertBulkResourcesSucceeded`, the two job interfaces, ~200 lines).
  `pollJobCompletion` calls `this.tryAdminBearer()`, `this.getGitHubToken()`
  and `this.logger`. Extracting it means passing an auth-header provider in —
  doable, but it is an interface design decision, not a move.
- **Page operations** (13 of the 16 public methods) all depend on the same
  private auth/error helpers. Splitting them means splitting the class into
  collaborating objects.

The file is still 1848 lines. Size alone did not justify going further in the
same session that changed its auth behaviour — see the "why it was deferred"
section above, which is the same argument and was right the first time.

## Kickoff prompt (supersedes the one above)

> Read this whole file, then RE-MEASURE — the table is dated and files move.
> The candidates ranked by coupling, not size, are `executor.ts` (23 non-type
> imports, 33 functions), `adobeEntityFetcher.ts` (21 methods) and the rest of
> `helixService.ts`. `configurationService.ts` is over on size only; leave it.
> For `helixService.ts` the next cut is the bulk-job protocol, and it needs an
> auth-header provider passed in rather than `this` — design that interface
> before moving code. `helixKeyStore.ts` is the model for what a clean cut looks
> like. The bar is unchanged and non-negotiable: the existing suites pass
> UNTOUCHED. A test that has to change means the extraction changed behaviour.

1. Steps seem logical
2. Break them into separate steps
3. Do research for this. We should only support what is actually use according to YAGNI.
4. I feel like it should honor whatever Spectrum needs and what keeps the design system cohesive.
5. We have a hybrid design system here - custom components and spectrum components. Our goal should to end up with a single system that efficiently combines both without having to maintain two completely separate systems just for fallback purposes. That feels like too much code.  Do research. What do you suggest?
6. I feel like we should enforce token usage, but we need to figure out how to do that across the hybrid system we have (see previous question)
7. Rely on manual visual checks
8. Full unit and component tests. For all tests, we should follow what the codebase does and best practices for the app we are developing as we may find gaps in our current test coverage.
9. All of these feel important.
10. Depends on your decision
11. I don't know. Analyze the current directory structure and make a recommendation based on best practices.

1. Types organization: We have shared/types outside of src/. Then we have src/types. Then we have webview-ui/src/shared/types/. This seems confusing!

2. Core refactor: We have src/core/validation and we have shared/validation. We also have src/utils and src/core/utils/. Were these (and others) missed in our core/ refactor?

3. webview-ui: Is the feedback/ directory well structured?

4. What are the .d.ts.map files in webview-ui/hooks that seem to be all over the place?

5. Why do we have a spectrum-extended directory with nothing but an index.ts file?

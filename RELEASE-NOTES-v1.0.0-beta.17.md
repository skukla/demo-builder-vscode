# Adobe Demo Builder v1.0.0-beta.17

**Release Date**: October 14, 2025

> **Note**: This is the seventeenth beta iteration toward v1.0.0 stable release.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Dependency Gating for Homebrew Prerequisites

Fixed Install buttons appearing for fnm and git when Homebrew is not installed.

**Before:**
- fnm and git showed Install buttons even without Homebrew
- Clicking Install would fail since they require Homebrew
- Confusing UX - users could try to install in wrong order

**After:**
- fnm and git Install buttons are disabled until Homebrew is installed
- Clear dependency chain: Homebrew ‚Üí fnm ‚Üí Node ‚Üí aio-cli
- Prevents installation in wrong order

**What Changed:**
- Added `"depends": ["homebrew"]` to fnm prerequisite
- Added `"depends": ["homebrew"]` to git prerequisite
- Install buttons respect dependency chain

### 2. Homebrew-Specific Git Requirement

Changed git prerequisite to require **Homebrew's git** specifically, not Xcode or system git.

**Why:**
- Ensures consistent git version across all users
- Extension controls and manages the git version
- No surprises from Xcode git (which may be outdated or missing)
- Aligns with extension's philosophy of managing all prerequisites

**What Changed:**
- Check command: `git --version` ‚Üí `brew list git --versions`
- Only passes if git is installed via Homebrew
- Users with only Xcode git will see it as "not installed"

### 3. Per-Node-Version UI Without fnm

Fixed UI showing incorrect green checkmarks for Node versions when fnm is not installed.

**Before (Broken):**
```
Adobe I/O CLI ‚úó
  Node 20 ‚úì  ‚Üê Wrong! Shows green when fnm isn't even installed
  Node 24 ‚úì  ‚Üê Wrong!
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Adobe I/O CLI ‚úó
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Adobe I/O CLI requires fnm to be installed first
  Node 20 ‚úó  ‚Üê Correctly shows red X
  Node 24 ‚úó  ‚Üê Correctly shows red X
```

### 4. Dynamic Node Version Detection

No more hardcoded Node versions! The extension now:
- Tests ALL fnm Node versions by running `aio --version`
- Picks the highest working version automatically
- Works with any Node version combination (14, 20, 22, 24, etc.)

### 5. Strict fnm Requirement

Per-node-version prerequisites (like aio-cli) now REQUIRE fnm:
- No fallback to nvm or global Node
- Clear error message: "requires fnm to be installed first"
- Ensures proper isolation and version management

## üìù Summary of Changes

### Dependency Gating
- **fnm**: Now depends on Homebrew (Install button disabled until Homebrew is installed)
- **git**: Now depends on Homebrew (Install button disabled until Homebrew is installed)
- **Result**: Clear prerequisite installation order: Homebrew ‚Üí fnm/git ‚Üí Node ‚Üí aio-cli

### Git
- **Check**: Now specifically checks for Homebrew's git (`brew list git --versions`)
- **Install**: Already installs via Homebrew (`brew install git`)
- **Depends**: Added `"depends": ["homebrew"]` to prevent installation without Homebrew
- **Result**: Consistent git version for all users

### Adobe I/O CLI
- **Dynamic detection**: Finds highest working Node version automatically
- **fnm required**: Skip checks if fnm not installed, show proper errors in UI
- **Consistent version**: All aio commands use same Node version

### UI/UX
- Per-node-version status now shows correct red X icons when fnm is missing
- Clear warning messages about missing prerequisites
- No more false positive green checkmarks

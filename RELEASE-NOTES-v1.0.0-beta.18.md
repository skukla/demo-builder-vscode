# Adobe Demo Builder v1.0.0-beta.18

**Release Date**: October 14, 2025

> **Note**: This is the eighteenth beta iteration toward v1.0.0 stable release.

## ‚ú® New Features

### Interactive Homebrew Installation

Homebrew installation now opens VS Code's integrated terminal automatically and guides users through the interactive installation process.

**The Problem:**
- Homebrew requires user interaction (password + confirmation)
- Previous approach tried to run it non-interactively and failed
- Users couldn't complete the installation

**The Solution:**
Automated terminal-based installation with clear guidance:

1. User clicks `[Install]` on Homebrew
2. **Terminal opens automatically** with installation command running
3. **Notification guides user** through the process:
   - Press ENTER when prompted
   - Enter password when requested  
   - Wait for completion
   - Click Recheck when done
4. User interacts directly with Homebrew installer in terminal
5. After completion, user clicks `[Recheck]` to verify

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fully automated terminal opening and command execution
- ‚úÖ Clear step-by-step instructions in notification
- ‚úÖ User sees full installation output and progress
- ‚úÖ Extension remains responsive during installation
- ‚úÖ Familiar VS Code terminal experience

## üêõ Bug Fixes (from Beta.17)

### 1. Dependency Gating for Homebrew Prerequisites

Fixed Install buttons appearing for fnm and git when Homebrew is not installed.

- Added `"depends": ["homebrew"]` to fnm prerequisite
- Added `"depends": ["homebrew"]` to git prerequisite
- Clear dependency chain: Homebrew ‚Üí fnm/git ‚Üí Node ‚Üí aio-cli

### 2. Homebrew-Specific Git Requirement

Changed git prerequisite to require **Homebrew's git** specifically, not Xcode or system git.

- Check command: `git --version` ‚Üí `brew list git --versions`
- Ensures consistent git version across all users
- Extension controls and manages the git version

### 3. Per-Node-Version UI Without fnm

Fixed UI showing incorrect green checkmarks for Node versions when fnm is not installed.

- Per-node-version status now shows correct red X icons when fnm is missing
- Clear warning messages about missing prerequisites

### 4. Extension Update Progress

Fixed progress notification hanging at "Installing..." during extension updates.

- Progress notification now completes properly
- Reload prompt appears after progress completes (not during)
- No more hung notifications

## üìù Technical Details

### Interactive Installation Implementation

```typescript
// Detects interactive installations
if ((prereq.install as any)?.interactive) {
    await this.handleInteractiveInstall(prereqId, prereq, installPlan.steps || []);
    return;
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Opens VS Code integrated terminal
2. Executes installation command automatically
3. Shows user-friendly notification with instructions
4. Updates prerequisite status to "Installation running in terminal"
5. User completes installation interactively
6. User clicks Recheck to verify

### Prerequisites Configuration

```json
{
  "id": "homebrew",
  "install": {
    "interactive": true,
    "interactiveMode": "terminal",
    "steps": [{
      "commands": ["/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL ...)\""],
      "requiresUserInput": true
    }]
  }
}
```

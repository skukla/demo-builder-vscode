/* ============================================
   CUSTOM STYLES (LEGACY RE-EXPORT)

   DEPRECATED: This file now re-exports from modular CSS files.

   For new development, import from index.css instead:
   import '@/core/ui/styles/index.css';

   This file exists for backwards compatibility with existing
   imports. Content has been extracted to:
   - utilities/   - Typography, colors, layout, spacing, borders, buttons
   - components/  - Cards, timeline, dashboard, common styles

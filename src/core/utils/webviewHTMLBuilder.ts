/**
 * Webview HTML Builder (DEPRECATED - File Kept for Reference)
 *
 * This file has been deprecated in favor of getWebviewHTMLWithBundles.ts
 * which properly handles webpack's 4-bundle code-splitting pattern.
 *
 * The generateWebviewHTML() function has been removed as all webview commands
 * now use the getWebviewHTMLWithBundles() helper instead.
 *
 * Migration: All webview commands should use:
 * - getWebviewHTMLWithBundles() from '@/core/utils/getWebviewHTMLWithBundles'
 *
 * This file remains to preserve helper functions that might be useful in future.
 * If no references exist after 1-2 releases, this file can be safely deleted.
 */

// File intentionally left empty - all exports removed
// See getWebviewHTMLWithBundles.ts for current implementation

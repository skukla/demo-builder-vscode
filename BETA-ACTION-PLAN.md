## Emergency Procedures

### If Regression Detected

1. **Assess severity**
   - Critical (blocking users): Immediate hotfix
   - High (impacting features): Hotfix within 24 hours
   - Medium: Fix in next release
   - Low: Track for future fix

2. **Rollback if critical**
   ```bash
   # If v1.X.0 introduced regression
   git revert <commit-sha>
   git tag -a v1.X.1 -m "Hotfix: Revert problematic changes"
   git push origin master --tags
   ```

3. **Fix forward if possible**
   ```bash
   # Create hotfix branch
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
   # Make fix
   git commit -m "fix: [description]"
   # Test thoroughly
   git checkout master
   git merge hotfix/critical-fix
   git tag -a v1.X.1 -m "Hotfix: [description]"
   ```

4. **Post-mortem**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Update testing checklist
   - Improve process for next migration

### If Migration Blocked

1. **Pause migration**
   - Don't force it
   - Current state is stable

2. **Assess blocker**
   - Technical complexity?
   - Resource constraints?
   - Risk too high?

3. **Adjust plan**
   - Skip problematic feature
   - Get additional resources
   - Seek expert help
   - Consider alternative approach

4. **Communicate**
   - Update stakeholders
   - Revise timeline
   - Document decision

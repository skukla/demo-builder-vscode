# Release Notes - v1.0.0-beta.25

## 🎯 Intelligent Homebrew Installation Experience

This release transforms the Homebrew installation from a basic terminal handoff into a fully automated, user-friendly experience with intelligent completion detection and automatic PATH configuration.

### ✨ New Features

#### **1. Event-Driven Installation Monitoring**
- **File-based completion signals** replace inefficient polling
- Instant detection of success or failure (no 5-second delays)
- Zero CPU overhead while waiting for installation
- Smart timeout reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes (only for edge cases)

#### **2. Automatic PATH Configuration**
- Auto-writes Homebrew PATH to shell profile (`~/.zprofile` or `~/.bash_profile`)
- Detects user's shell automatically (zsh/bash)
- Prevents duplicate entries with smart detection
- Evaluates PATH in current process for immediate availability
- **Zero manual terminal commands required!**

#### **3. Real-Time Terminal Feedback**
- Injects status messages directly into terminal:
  - "✓ Installation complete! Configuring PATH..."
  - "✓ PATH configured successfully!"
  - "✅ All done! The wizard will continue automatically."
- Clear guidance: "You can close this terminal (Cmd+W) or leave it open for reference"

#### **4. Flexible Completion Flow**
- **Notification appears** with two clear options:
  - "Continue & Close Terminal" - closes terminal immediately
  - "Continue" - leaves terminal open for reference
- **Wizard ALWAYS continues** regardless of user choice (no blocking!)
- Terminal can be kept open for debugging/review without delaying progress

#### **5. Intelligent Failure Handling**
- Instant failure detection via failure marker file
- Clear error state in UI with actionable message
- Terminal stays open on failure for error review
- One-click retry with "Install in Terminal" button

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Completion Detection:**
```bash
# Command executed in terminal:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl ...)" && echo "SUCCESS" > "/tmp/demo-builder-homebrew-{timestamp}.complete" || echo "FAILED" > "/tmp/demo-builder-homebrew-{timestamp}.failed"
```

**File System Watcher:**
- Monitors temp directory for success/failure markers
- Instant notification via `fs.watch()` (not polling)
- Fast-path check for immediate completion scenarios
- Automatic marker cleanup after detection

**PATH Configuration:**
- Appends to shell profile: `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`
- Adds comment: `# Homebrew PATH (auto-configured by Adobe Demo Builder)`
- Skips if already configured (idempotent)

### 🎯 User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ User had to manually run PATH configuration commands
- ❌ No feedback on what extension was doing
- ❌ Unclear when to proceed with wizard
- ❌ Terminal auto-closed without user control

**After:**
- ✅ Fully automated PATH configuration
- ✅ Clear real-time feedback in terminal
- ✅ Wizard continues automatically
- ✅ User controls when terminal closes
- ✅ Terminal can stay open for reference

### 📋 Complete Installation Flow

1. User clicks "Install in Terminal"
2. Terminal opens with Homebrew installer
3. User enters password and confirms
4. Installation completes
5. **Extension auto-configures PATH** (no manual commands!)
6. **Terminal shows success messages**
7. **Notification appears** with Continue options
8. **Wizard proceeds automatically** (user chooses terminal close behavior)

### 🐛 Edge Case Handling

- **User cancels (Ctrl+C):** 2-minute timeout → clear message to retry
- **User closes terminal early:** 2-minute timeout → clear message
- **Network hangs:** 2-minute timeout → clear message
- **Installation fails:** Instant detection → error state → actionable retry

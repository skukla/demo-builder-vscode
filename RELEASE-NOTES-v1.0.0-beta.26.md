# Release Notes - v1.0.0-beta.26

## üé® UX Polish: Configure Screen & Success Notifications

This release addresses two UX concerns in the Configure screen: unclear button labeling and hard-to-notice success feedback.

### ‚ú® Changes

#### **1. "Cancel" ‚Üí "Close" Button Label**
**Location:** Configure screen footer

**Before:**
```
[Cancel]  [Save Configuration]
```

**After:**
```
[Close]  [Save Configuration]
```

**Why:** The "Cancel" label was misleading because:
- Clicking "Save" doesn't close the view (allows multiple saves)
- Users aren't canceling any operation
- "Close" accurately describes what the button does

**Impact:** More intuitive action label that matches the actual behavior.

#### **2. Prominent Success Notifications**
**Location:** All success messages across extension

**Before:**
- Subtle status bar message at bottom (‚úÖ Configuration saved successfully)
- Easy to miss, especially when focused on the main content area

**After:**
- **Notification popup** appears prominently in top-right corner
- **PLUS** status bar message (dual feedback)
- Auto-dismisses (no user action required)

**Affected Messages:**
- ‚úÖ Configuration saved successfully
- ‚úÖ API Mesh deployed successfully  
- ‚úÖ Demo started at http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Demo stopped successfully
- ‚úÖ Project deleted successfully

**Why:** Status bar messages alone are too subtle, especially in the Configure screen where users are focused on the form. The prominent notification ensures users always see confirmation of their actions.

### üéØ User Experience Impact

**Configure Screen Workflow:**
1. User makes configuration changes
2. Clicks "Save Configuration"
3. **Prominent notification appears:** "‚úÖ Configuration saved successfully"
4. **Status bar also shows:** "‚úÖ Configuration saved successfully" (5 seconds)
5. User can make more changes and save again
6. When done, clicks "Close" (was "Cancel") to exit

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Impossible to miss save confirmations
- ‚úÖ Clear exit action ("Close" not "Cancel")
- ‚úÖ Dual feedback (notification + status bar)
- ‚úÖ No workflow interruption (auto-dismissing)
- ‚úÖ Consistent across all operations

### üìù Technical Details

**Implementation:**
- Modified `baseCommand.ts` `showSuccessMessage()` to use `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()` in addition to status bar
- Updated Configure screen button label from "Cancel" to "Close"
- No behavior changes, only presentation improvements

**Consistency:**
All commands inheriting from `BaseCommand` automatically benefit from the improved success notifications.

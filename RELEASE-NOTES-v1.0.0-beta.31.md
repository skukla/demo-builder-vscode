# Release Notes - v1.0.0-beta.31

## 🎨 UX Improvement: Visual Progress Indicator for Component Updates

### Problem
When clicking "Update All" or "Components Only", the notification would immediately disappear with no visual feedback that updates were happening. Users had to check logs to see if anything was working.

**User Experience:**
```
1. User clicks "Update Components"
2. Notification disappears instantly
3. ??? (nothing happening on screen)
4. User checks logs to see progress
5. Update completes silently
```

---

## The Fix

**Added `vscode.window.withProgress` wrapper** around component updates to provide real-time visual feedback.

### New User Experience

**Progress Notification Shows:**
```
Updating Components
(1/2) Updating citisignal-nextjs...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 50%

(2/2) Updating commerce-mesh...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%

Saving project state...
```

**What Users See:**
- ✅ Persistent notification during update process
- ✅ Current component being updated (1/2, 2/2, etc.)
- ✅ Progress bar with percentage
- ✅ "Saving project state..." message at end
- ✅ Notification stays visible until completion
- ✅ Clear visual feedback throughout entire process

---

## Changes

**Modified:** `src/commands/checkUpdates.ts`
- Wrapped `performComponentUpdates` logic in `vscode.window.withProgress`
- Added progress reporting for each component
- Shows component count (e.g., "1/2") and name
- Incremental progress bar updates
- Final "Saving project state..." message

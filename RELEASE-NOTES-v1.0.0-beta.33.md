# Release Notes - v1.0.0-beta.33

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Node 24 Compatibility

This release fixes a critical bug where the extension would detect and use Node 24, which is **not supported** by the Adobe CLI SDK.

---

## The Problem

The Adobe CLI SDK (used for organization/project operations) only supports **Node 18, 20, or 22**. However, the extension's Node version detection logic would pick the **highest** Node version with `aio-cli` installed, which could be Node 24.

### Error Symptoms

**User Experience:**
- ‚ùå Authentication appears to succeed
- ‚ùå "Getting Organizations..." fails with error
- ‚ùå Can't proceed past organization selection

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Failed to get organizations: - Getting Organizations...
‚Ä∫   Error: [CoreConsoleAPISDK:ERROR_GET_ORGANIZATIONS] TypeError: Bearer
‚Ä∫   Warning: Node.js version v24.10.0 is not supported. Supported versions are
‚Ä∫    ^18 || ^20 || ^22.
```

### Root Cause

The `findAdobeCLINodeVersion()` method would:
1. Find all fnm-managed Node versions with `aio-cli` installed
2. Sort them by version (descending)
3. Pick the **highest** version (e.g., Node 24)
4. Use that version for all Adobe CLI commands

This worked for `aio auth` and `aio config`, but **failed** when using the Adobe CLI SDK for organization operations.

---

## The Fix

**Modified:** `src/utils/externalCommandManager.ts`

Added a compatibility filter to only consider Node versions supported by Adobe CLI SDK:

```typescript
// Adobe CLI SDK supports Node 18, 20, and 22 only (not 24+)
// See: https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-core-console-api
const SUPPORTED_NODE_VERSIONS = [18, 20, 22];

// Skip Node versions not supported by Adobe CLI SDK
if (!SUPPORTED_NODE_VERSIONS.includes(major)) {
    this.logger.debug(`[Adobe CLI] Node v${major}: skipping (Adobe CLI SDK requires ^18 || ^20 || ^22)`);
    continue;
}
```

Now the extension will:
1. Find all fnm-managed Node versions with `aio-cli` installed
2. **Filter to only Node 18, 20, or 22**
3. Sort remaining versions (descending)
4. Pick the **highest compatible** version (e.g., Node 22 if available, else 20, else 18)

---

## Version Selection Priority

The extension now selects Node versions in this order:
1. **Node 22** (highest supported)
2. **Node 20** (if 22 not available)
3. **Node 18** (if 20 not available)

**Node 24+ are skipped entirely** to ensure compatibility with Adobe CLI SDK.

---

## Impact

### Who Was Affected

This bug affected users who:
- Had Node 24 installed via fnm
- Had `aio-cli` installed globally in Node 24
- Were trying to select organizations or projects

### What's Fixed

‚úÖ Extension skips Node 24 and uses Node 22/20/18 instead  
‚úÖ Organization selection works correctly  
‚úÖ Project selection works correctly  
‚úÖ All Adobe CLI SDK operations work properly  
‚úÖ Clear debug logging shows which Node versions are skipped and why

---

## Debug Logging

The extension now logs when skipping incompatible Node versions:

```
[Adobe CLI] Node v24: skipping (Adobe CLI SDK requires ^18 || ^20 || ^22)
[Adobe CLI] Node v22: aio-cli works ‚úì
[Adobe CLI] Found 1 fnm Node version(s) with working aio-cli, using highest: Node v22
```

This makes it clear which Node version is being used and why.

---

## For Users with Node 24

**If you have Node 24 installed:**
1. The extension will automatically skip it and use Node 22/20/18
2. No action required on your part
3. Check debug logs to confirm which Node version is being used

**If you only have Node 24 installed:**
1. The extension will warn that no compatible Node version is available
2. Install Node 22, 20, or 18 via fnm:
   ```bash
   fnm install 22
   fnm use 22
   npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
   ```

---

## Technical Details

### Adobe CLI SDK Compatibility

The Adobe CLI SDK (`@adobe/aio-lib-core-console-api`) explicitly requires:
- **Node 18.x** (^18)
- **Node 20.x** (^20)
- **Node 22.x** (^22)

Node 24+ introduces breaking changes that the SDK hasn't yet adapted to.

### Why This Matters

The Adobe CLI has two distinct components:
1. **Adobe CLI commands** (`aio auth`, `aio config`, etc.) - Work on any Node version
2. **Adobe CLI SDK** (organization/project operations) - Requires Node 18/20/22

This is why authentication appeared to work (it uses CLI commands) but organization selection failed (it uses SDK).

---

## Testing

### Before Fix
1. User with Node 24 and `aio-cli` installed
2. Try to authenticate ‚Üí Succeeds ‚úì
3. Try to select organization ‚Üí Fails with "Node.js version v24.10.0 is not supported" ‚ùå

### After Fix
1. Same user with Node 24 and Node 22 both installed
2. Extension automatically skips Node 24, uses Node 22
3. Authentication works ‚úì
4. Organization selection works ‚úì

---

## Upgrade Notes

**Automatic:** No migration needed. The fix applies immediately on extension reload.

**For Users with Node 24:**
- If you also have Node 22/20/18, the extension will automatically use the highest compatible version
- If you only have Node 24, install a compatible version: `fnm install 22`

---

## Summary

v1.0.0-beta.33 ensures the extension only uses Node versions compatible with the Adobe CLI SDK (18, 20, 22), preventing errors during organization and project operations.

**If you experienced "Node.js version v24.10.0 is not supported" errors in v1.0.0-beta.32 and earlier, this release resolves them completely.**

---

## Related to v1.0.0-beta.32

This release builds on v1.0.0-beta.32's path quoting fix. Together, these releases ensure:
- ‚úÖ Paths with spaces work correctly (v1.0.0-beta.32)
- ‚úÖ Compatible Node versions used (v1.0.0-beta.33)

Both fixes are critical for reliable Adobe CLI operations.

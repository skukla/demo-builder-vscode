# Adobe Demo Builder v1.0.0-beta.14

**Release Date**: October 14, 2025

> **Note**: This is the fourteenth beta iteration toward v1.0.0 stable release.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed Per-Node-Version Plugin Checks

Fixed a critical bug where aio-cli plugin checks (like `api-mesh`) were running under the wrong Node version.

### Improved Authentication Error Logging

Added detailed error logging for Adobe authentication failures to help diagnose login issues.

### The Problem

When checking aio-cli under Node 20 (for per-node-version prerequisites):
- The main aio-cli check correctly used Node 20  ‚úì
- But the plugin check (`aio plugins`) incorrectly auto-detected and used Node 14 ‚úó
- This caused plugin checks to fail or check the wrong installation

**Example from logs:**
```
[Prereq Check] aio-cli: Checking under fnm's Node v20  ‚Üê Correct!
[Prereq Check] aio-cli: ‚úì Found under fnm's Node v20
[Adobe CLI] Found in Node v14.17.0, using version family: 14  ‚Üê Wrong!
```

### The Fix

Plugin checks now use the same Node version as their parent prerequisite:
- If aio-cli is checked under Node 20, plugins are also checked under Node 20
- Consistent Node version throughout the entire prerequisite check process
- No more switching to unexpected Node versions

## üìù Changes

### Bug Fix
- **Fixed plugin checks for per-node-version prerequisites**
  - Plugin checks now inherit the Node version from parent prerequisite
  - Prevents auto-detection from finding wrong Node versions
  - Ensures aio-cli and its plugins are checked in the same Node environment

### Technical Details
- Modified `checkPrerequisite()` to pass Node version to `checkPlugin()`
- Updated `checkPlugin()` to accept and use the specified Node version
- Falls back to 'auto' detection only for non-per-node-version prerequisites
